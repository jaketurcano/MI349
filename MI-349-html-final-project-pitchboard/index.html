  <h1>Student Portfolio Website</h1>
  <p>
    The Student Portfolio Website is a template for all those who seek to
    promote themselevs and their work by publicly displaying and sharing it with
    peers and job recruiters.

    Following graduation, many students do not know the best action to take for
    finding a job that will best suit them. Part of this issue comes from the
    lacking knowledge of how to market oneself besides a resume and possibly a
    linkedin page. Despite this, companies still search for a stand-out factor
    in deciding between candidates. This means every piece you market yourself
    with should better your chances at finding a job, or at least standing out
    to recruiters. One method of presenting yourself in a different way is by
    displaying all of your professional goals and acheivments on an accessible
    website. Doing this makes it easier to find information on potential job
    candidates as well as simplifying sharing resources or contact information. 
    However, this prime example of marketing yourself can only be useful if you
    have a prior knowledge of web development and its subsequent frameworks.
    That is why I propose making a general web template for students to display
    whatever information about them they want in order to build a personal
    portfolio.
