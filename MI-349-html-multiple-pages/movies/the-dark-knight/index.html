  <h1>The Dark Knight</h1>
  <p>
    My other favorite movie is the super hero movie
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Knight_(film)" 
      target="_blank">The Dark Knight (2008)</a>.
    This is a sequel to the movie Batman Begins, which both are coincidentally 
    directed by Christopher Nolan who also directed Interstellar. This movie
    introduces us to the Joker as the villain who tries to create chaos in
    Gotham. Batman fights to stop him while saving citizens and trying to keep
    his friends safe. This is one of my all time favorite movies for many
    reasons. Batman is my favorite comic book character and Joker is one of my
    favorite villains. I think Heath Ledger played an amazing Joker, and
    everything between the acting, set designs, music, and special
    effects were incredible.
