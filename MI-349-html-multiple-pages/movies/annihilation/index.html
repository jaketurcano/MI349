  <h1>Annihilation</h1>
  <p>
    One of my favorite movies is a psycological horror named 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annihilation_(film)" target="_blank">
      Annihilation (2018)</a>. 
    It is a movie about a meteor that crashes on earth and carries some alien
    life which alters the DNA of the world around it, such as plants, animals,
    and humans. It's one of my top choices because of the themes and messages it
    conveys through its story telling, as well as the amazing visuals that can 
    sometimes be both beautiful and disturbing.
